## Overview

With a population of 1.4 billion (U.S. Census Bureau) and more than 4 million invention patents (CGTN, 2024), China has positioned itself as a major player in global innovation, rivaling Western nations like the United States. Because of their different political and cultural contexts, China and the US approach AI in education in contrasting ways. 

- The **United States** favors a **non-government sponsored approach**, balancing both technical and social factors.
- **China**, by contrast, follows a **government-driven model**, emphasizing technical over social considerations (Pu, 2024).

Despite these differences, both countries aim to embed AI at every educational level to build human capital and support economic growth.

## Using EEG to Monitor Learning

A key example of AI in China’s classrooms is the use of **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** technology. EEG monitors students' attention and engagement by collecting data from:

- EEG signals
- School records
- Teacher observations

This data is analyzed to understand how variables like time of day, subject matter, classroom environment, and teaching style affect students' emotional states and focus.

## Data Processing and Machine Learning

For effective predictions and insights, it is critical to:

- **Clean the data** by removing noise such as eye blinks, body movements, and other artifacts.
- **Perform frequency band analysis** to identify brainwave patterns.

The following classification algorithms are typically used on such datasets (Seid & Elgazzar, 2021):

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

These models learn from the EEG dataset and predict attention levels or emotional states, supporting real-time interventions in the classroom.

## Is EEG in Education Too Intrusive?

While EEG technology promises to enhance learning by tailoring instruction and identifying struggling students, it also raises significant ethical concerns:

- **Privacy:** Sensitive brain data could be misused or inadequately protected.
- **Comfort and distraction:** Wearing EEG headsets might be uncomfortable or divert attention.
- **Data accuracy:** Misinterpretation of EEG signals could lead to flawed decisions.

**How do you feel about the use of EEG in education?**  
Do you think the potential to improve teaching and learning outweighs the privacy and ethical risks?
